        <h2>Steganography</h2>
        <div class="service-item">
            <p>Steganography is the practice of concealing messages or information within other non-secret text or data,
                making the hidden content undetectable to casual inspection. Unlike cryptography, which only obscures the
                content of a message, steganography hides the very existence of the message. This technique can be applied
                to various media, such as images, audio files, and videos, where the hidden message is embedded in a way
                that it appears as part of the original file.</p>

        <h2>LSB Algorithm</h2>
        <div class="service-item">
            <h3>Simple and easy to understand</h3>
            <p>The Least Significant Bit (LSB) algorithm is popular in digital steganography due to its simplicity and ease
                of understanding. By altering the least significant bits of the data within media files like images, it
                allows for the embedding of secret information with minimal impact on the original file's quality.
                This straightforward method makes it accessible to those with basic programming knowledge, while also providing
                a high capacity for hidden data and maintaining computational efficiency. Despite its simplicity, the LSB algorithm
                can effectively conceal data.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="service-item">
            <h3>Commonly used for educational purposes </h3>
            <p>The Least Significant Bit (LSB) algorithm is a technique used to hide data
                within the least significant bits of image pixel values. In this approach, the least significant bit of the red, green,
                or blue color channels of each pixel is modified to store the bits of a secret message. Since changing the least
                significant bit results in minimal change to the pixel's overall color, the human eye cannot easily detect the difference.
                In this implementation, the message is broken down into individual bits, and each bit is sequentially inserted into the
                LSB of the red channel of each pixel. By embedding the message in this subtle manner, LSB steganography allows for covert
                communication while preserving the visual integrity of the image.</p>

        <h2>AES Algorithm</h2>
        <div class="service-item">
            <h3>AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)</h3>
            <p>AES is used to encrypt the secret message before embedding it into the image. The encryption is done with a 128-bit key (16 bytes)
                provided by the user, ensuring the message is secure before it is hidden. The AesUtil.encrypt method takes the secret message and
                the provided AES key (generated from the user input) to produce an encrypted version of the message. This ensures that even if
                someone manages to extract the hidden data from the image, it will remain unreadable without the correct AES key to decrypt it.
                This adds an extra layer of security to the steganography process.</p>

        <h2>SHA-256 Algorithm</h2>
        <div class="service-item">
            <h3>SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm)</h3>
            <p>SHA-256 is used to convert the provided key into a fixed-length 256-bit (32-byte) hash. The method
                getKeyBytes takes the input key (a string) and applies the SHA-256 algorithm to generate a secure hash. This hash is used to ensure
                that the key is transformed into a consistent and secure format before it is embedded into the WAV file for steganography. By using
                SHA-256, the key becomes highly secure, resistant to brute force attacks, and is guaranteed to always produce the same 256-bit output
                for the same input, ensuring that the key is both secure and consistent for the encoding and decoding process.</p>
